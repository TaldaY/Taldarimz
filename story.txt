long time ago, Yimin walked along a street. He was boring until he saw a cat.
The cat approached him. It seems trying to ask food from him. Yimin began approaching the cat, but before he could notice anything strange,
it attacked. It indeed was hungry. For him.
THe cat ate Yimin's left arm and then left. Yimin was bleeding. He was in panic.
He called 911. Police did not believe what they heard, until a monster cat appeared in front of the door of police station.
